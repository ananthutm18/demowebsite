        <h2 style="color: blue;">Basic gym policies</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of our gym policies to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all members:

           <br><br> <h3>Membership Card:</h3> Please remember to bring your membership card with you every time you visit the gym. This helps us maintain security and track attendance accurately.
            
           <br><br> <h3>Dress Code:</h3> Proper gym attire, including athletic shoes, is required at all times. This ensures safety and hygiene during workouts.
            
           <br><br> <h3>Equipment Use:</h3> Please use gym equipment responsibly and follow instructions for proper usage. Wipe down equipment after use to maintain cleanliness.
            
            <br><br><h3>Safety:</h3> Safety is our top priority. Please refrain from dropping weights, running in the gym, or engaging in reckless behavior that may endanger yourself or others.
            
           <br><br> <h3>Respect:</h3> Show respect to fellow members and staff. Keep noise levels reasonable, refrain from hogging equipment, and follow etiquette in shared spaces.
        </p><br>

        <h2 style="color: blue;">Fees and Re fund policies</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> we strive to provide transparent and fair fee structures along with flexible refund policies to accommodate the needs of our members. Here's an overview of our policies:

            <br><br> <h3>Membership Fees:</h3> Our membership fees are structured to offer various options, including monthly, quarterly, and annual memberships, with discounts available for longer-term commitments. We also offer different tiers of membership with varying benefits to suit individual preferences.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Initiation Fees:</h3> Some membership plans may include a one-time initiation fee. This fee covers administrative costs associated with setting up new memberships and access to our facilities.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Refund Policy:</h3> We understand that circumstances may change, and therefore, we offer a refund policy for membership fees. Refunds are typically provided in accordance with the terms outlined in the membership agreement.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Cancellation Policy:</h3>Cancellation Policy: Members have the option to cancel their membership at any time, subject to the terms specified in their membership agreement. Depending on the membership plan chosen, there may be different notice periods required for cancellation.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Pro-rated Refunds:</h3>  If a member chooses to cancel their membership before the end of a billing cycle, we offer pro-rated refunds for the unused portion of their membership fees. This ensures fairness and transparency in our refund process.
        </p><br>
        
        <h2 style="color: blue;">Gym Rule Breaking Policy</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Gym Rule Breaking Policy
            
            At our gym, we value the safety, comfort, and overall positive experience of all our members. To uphold these standards, we have implemented a strict rule-breaking policy that ensures everyone can enjoy their workout environment to the fullest. Here's a breakdown of our policy:
            
            <br><br> <h3>Clear Communication:</h3> We believe in transparent communication regarding our gym rules. All members are provided with a comprehensive list of rules upon sign-up, and these rules are visibly displayed throughout the facility.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Zero Tolerance for Safety Violations: </h3>Safety is our top priority. Any behavior that compromises the safety of oneself or others will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to reckless lifting, improper equipment use, and failure to sanitize equipment after use.
            
            <br><br> <h3>Respect for Equipment and Facilities: </h3> We expect all members to treat gym equipment and facilities with respect. Deliberate misuse, vandalism, or neglect of equipment will result in disciplinary action.</p><br>
